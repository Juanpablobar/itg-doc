# VTEX Scheduler

## Description
This documentation provides examples of using cURL commands to interact with the VTEX Scheduler API. It covers the PUT, GET, and DELETE HTTP methods to schedule, retrieve, and delete jobs, respectively. The PUT method schedules a job that pings a specified URI at regular intervals defined by a cron expression. The GET method retrieves the details of a scheduled job, while the DELETE method removes a scheduled job. Each example includes the necessary headers for authentication and specifies the required URL structure and data payload.
